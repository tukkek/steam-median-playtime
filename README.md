# Show Steam reviews' median playtime

Does what it says on the tin! For [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or any other Greasemonkey-compatible userscript add-ons for your browser.

## Instructions:

1. Install the script by navigating to [this page](https://github.com/tukkek/steam-median-playtime/raw/master/Steam%20median%20playtime.user.js). If that doesn't work, right-click the link, "Save as..." and then follow your userscript add-on's instructions on how to import the saved file.
2. Navigate to a Steam Store product page.
3. Make sure the reviews are loaded by scrolling down until you are able to see them (or click on the header's "All reviews" or "Recent reviews" links)
4. Open the userscript add-on's icon or menu and click on "Show median playtime".
